@ARTICLE{Matsuya_2013,title={Legal Protection of Software - Copyright, Patent and Open Source - Challenges for Business in a Mixed Environment},year={2013},author={Yuko Matsuya},doi={null},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={2269121728},journal={null},abstract={This thesis aims to provide clues on how software developers could use and distribute proprietary software and open source software to run their business smoothly.Proprietary software is protected by copyright and/or patent that confers the rightholders exclusive rights for the use of their software. The developers of proprietary software use their exclusive rights to secure profits in their businesses. Open source licenses are built upon the existing copyright system to ensure the freedom of use, modification and redistribution of software for the recipients of the software.In this thesis, first, legal basis for software protection available in the European Union (EU), the United States (US) and Japan will be described. Next, the history and characteristics as well as legal issues of open source licenses will be discussed. Further considerations will cover possible legal problems arise around proprietary software and OSS business models. Based on these discussions, possible best practices will be suggested for software developers to protect their software.}}

	abstract = {The continuously increasing gap between silicon and designer productivity has created a need for common design reuse. The initial response to this need emphasized the enforcement of designers’ rights through the creation of design such that ownership can be proved with ultra high probability. Our primary objective is to provide sound treatment of the foundations of hardware watermarking and ﬁngerprinting, as well as key research contributions to the ﬁeld. At the same time, we aim not just to survey and explain key ideas, concepts, and tools but also to identify dominating trends and brieﬂy outline emerging hardware IP protection and, in particular, hardware watermarking and ﬁngerprinting issues including the creation and validation of trusted hardware IP and semantic IP rights protection. Finally, we also elaborate on changing focus from techniques for embedding watermarks and ﬁngerprints to approaches for watermark and ﬁngerprint extraction and on remote digital rights enforcement of hardware IP rights.},
