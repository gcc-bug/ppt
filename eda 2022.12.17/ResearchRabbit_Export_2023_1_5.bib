@ARTICLE{Nash_2020,title={Quantum circuit optimizations for NISQ architectures},year={2020},author={Beatrice Nash and Beatrice Nash and Vlad Gheorghiu and Michele Mosca},doi={10.1088/2058-9565/ab79b1},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={3101571824},journal={Quantum Science and Technology},abstract={Currently available quantum computing hardware platforms have limited 2-qubit connectivity among their addressable qubits. In order to run a generic quantum algorithm on such a platform, one has to transform the initial logical quantum circuit describing the algorithm into an equivalent one that obeys the connectivity restrictions. 
In this work we construct a circuit synthesis scheme that takes as input the qubit connectivity graph and a quantum circuit over the gate set generated by $\{\text{CNOT},R_{Z}\}$ and outputs a circuit that respects the connectivity of the device. As a concrete application, we apply our techniques to Google's Bristlecone 72-qubit quantum chip connectivity, IBM's Tokyo 20-qubit quantum chip connectivity, and Rigetti's Acorn 19-qubit quantum chip connectivity. In addition, we also compare the performance of our scheme as a function of sparseness of randomly generated quantum circuits. 
Note: Recently, the authors of arXiv:1904.00633 independently presented a similar optimization scheme. Our work is independent of arXiv:1904.00633, being a longer version of the seminar presented by Beatrice Nash at the Dagstuhl Seminar 18381: Quantum Programming Languages, pg. 120, September 2018, Dagstuhl, Germany, slide deck available online at this https URL.}}

Here, we develop a two-dimensional programmable superconducting quantum processor, \textit{Zuchongzhi}, which is composed of 66 functional qubits in a tunable coupling architecture. To characterize the performance of the whole system, we perform random quantum circuits sampling for benchmarking, up to a system size of 56 qubits and 20 cycles. The computational cost of the classical simulation of this task is estimated to be 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than the previous work on 53-qubit Sycamore processor [Nature \textbf{574}, 505 (2019)]. We estimate that the sampling task finished by \textit{Zuchongzhi} in about 1.2 hours will take the most powerful supercomputer at least 8 years. Our work establishes an unambiguous quantum computational advantage that is infeasible for classical computation in a reasonable amount of time. The high-precision and programmable quantum computing platform opens a new door to explore novel many-body phenomena and implement complex quantum algorithms.}}

Here we present a polynomial-time algorithm for optimizing quantum circuits that takes the actual implementation of fault-tolerant logical gates into consideration. Our algorithm resynthesizes quantum circuits composed of Clifford group and T gates, the latter being typically the most costly gate in fault-tolerant models, e.g., those based on the Steane or surface codes, with the purpose of minimizing both T-count and T-depth. A major feature of the algorithm is the ability to resynthesize circuits with ancillae at effectively no additional cost, allowing space-time trade-offs to be easily explored. The tested benchmarks show up to 65.7% reduction in T-count and up to 87.6% reduction in T-depth without ancillae, or 99.7% reduction in T-depth using ancillae.}}

We give an algorithm that is optimal up to a multiplicative constant, and Î˜(log n) times faster than previous methods. While our results are primarily asymptotic, simulation results show that even for relatively small n our algorithm is faster and yields smaller circuits than the standard method. The proposed algorithm has direct applications to the synthesis of stabilizer circuits, an important class of quantum circuits. Generically our algorithm can be interpreted as a matrix decomposition algorithm, yielding an asymptotically efficient decomposition of a binary matrix into a product of elementary matrices.}}
