@ARTICLE{Nash_2020,title={Quantum circuit optimizations for NISQ architectures},year={2020},author={Beatrice Nash and Beatrice Nash and Vlad Gheorghiu and Michele Mosca},doi={10.1088/2058-9565/ab79b1},pmid={null},pmcid={null},mag_id={3101571824},journal={Quantum Science and Technology},abstract={Currently available quantum computing hardware platforms have limited 2-qubit connectivity among their addressable qubits. In order to run a generic quantum algorithm on such a platform, one has to transform the initial logical quantum circuit describing the algorithm into an equivalent one that obeys the connectivity restrictions. 
In this work we construct a circuit synthesis scheme that takes as input the qubit connectivity graph and a quantum circuit over the gate set generated by $\{\text{CNOT},R_{Z}\}$ and outputs a circuit that respects the connectivity of the device. As a concrete application, we apply our techniques to Google's Bristlecone 72-qubit quantum chip connectivity, IBM's Tokyo 20-qubit quantum chip connectivity, and Rigetti's Acorn 19-qubit quantum chip connectivity. In addition, we also compare the performance of our scheme as a function of sparseness of randomly generated quantum circuits. 
Note: Recently, the authors of arXiv:1904.00633 independently presented a similar optimization scheme. Our work is independent of arXiv:1904.00633, being a longer version of the seminar presented by Beatrice Nash at the Dagstuhl Seminar 18381: Quantum Programming Languages, pg. 120, September 2018, Dagstuhl, Germany, slide deck available online at this https URL.}}
