**Objective (4/5):**

This paper introduces Geyser, a compilation framework designed to enhance output fidelity in quantum programs for neutral-atom quantum architectures.

**Challenges (4/5):**

Neutral-atom qubits, despite their potential advantages, have received relatively limited attention compared to superconducting qubits. Adapting quantum circuits for multi-qubit operations on neutral-atom qubits presents a unique challenge.

Geyser helps overcome the unique challenges of neutral-atom architectures (the interaction radius) and take advantage of their benefits (native multi-qubit operations like CCZ gate).

**Key Contributions (3/5):**

- Geyser introduces novel concepts like circuit blocking and composition to reduce circuit depth and minimize the number of pulses.
- It optimizes compilation using native multi-qubit support, including the CCZ gate.

**Noteworthy (1/5):**

While the circuit mapping step draws from existing techniques for superconducting qubits (qiskit for mapping), Geyser's unique strategies deliver significant performance improvements.

**Results (3/5):**

Geyser reduces circuit pulses by 25-90% and improves output fidelity by 25-60%, outperforming compilers without mapping optimizations.
