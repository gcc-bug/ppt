Dear all:
This Tuesday afternoon, I will introduce a  collection  of  modular  open  source C++ libraries for the development of logic synthesis applications by EPFL. And then I will introduce a quantum compilation flow based on these libraries, starting with Boolean functions. 
Please find the meeting information below.
Best wishes
