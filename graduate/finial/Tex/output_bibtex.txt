The logic embodies the postulates of quantum physics and it was designed from the semantics upwards by identifying quantum models with superpositions of classical models. This novel approach to quantum logic is completely different from the traditional approach of Birkhoff and von Neumann. It has the advantage of making quantum logic an extension of classical logic. The key new ingredient of the language of the proposed logic is a rather general modal operator},
